`tea` is a set of libraries developed for common tasks like executing and
manipulating processes, sending emails, file system manipulation, and a great
number of utility functions that I caught myself writing over and over again.

Also parts of the `tea` library can be viewed as a sand-box where I start
a module, which eventually, if it grows and become large enough to become a
library itself, gets extracted as a separate project.

Modules like `dsa` (data structures and algorithms), `logger`, `msg`,
`process`, `shell`, `utils`... will always remain a part of `tea`.
